## Hello there! 

Welcome to my corner of the web, filled with math, programming and other thing which interests me.

I'm Elias and come from a small city up in northern Sweden. I pursue a M.Sc. in Engineering Physics at Ume√• University, and I am currently doing an exchange in Heidelberg, Germany.

This is a personal page where I share whatever thoughts are going through my head at the moment, or what I have been up to lately.
